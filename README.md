# Django Boards application

This is a Django application called Django Boards, based on Vitor Freitas' Django Boards application in his tutorial series called [A Complete Beginner's Guide to Django](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/beginners-guide/1.11/) from 2017. When I came across it, I thought it would be great for my technical documentation portfolio to refactor/update the application to 2024 standards and code, as well as add my own features to it.

**11.14.24**: I have completed the local development of my version of Django Boards, and it is hosted here on Github in this repository called [django-boards](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/django-boards/tree/main). I am now working on part 30, which consists of preparation for deployment. I am still debating between deploying to Heroku (their documentation is broken as well as incomplete) and AWS. Deployment to Heroku would still include hosting images on AWS S3 since Heroku does not support user image uploads. I should have part 30 completed soon, and completed deployment thereafter. Stay tuned!
